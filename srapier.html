<p><H3> Thibaults Circle</H3></p>

	<p>The above picture is a representation of The Spanish fencing circle.  Unbeknownst to most people when 2 people fought in the <b>Spanish Rapier style or "La Verdadera Destreza," </b>The Circle was not a stationary thing which restricted the Fighters movement.  Rather the Circle moved with the Fighters, The fighters almost always being at opposite ends of the circle, walking the perimiter and when one of them moved forward, the other would move back, thus preserving the circle.  The only time someone would step into the circle would be to make an attack along a diangle, which is represented by the lines drawn on the Circle.  This Fighters themselfs are however in no way limited to the Diagonals drawn on the circle and can make their own whenever the opportunity of a safe attack presents itself.</p>
