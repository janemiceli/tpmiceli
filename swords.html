<H4>"Young knight learn, 
<BR>to love God and revere women, 
<BR>so that your honour grows. 
<BR>Practice knighthood and learn 
<BR>the Art that dignifies you, 
<BR>and brings you honour in wars. 
<BR>Wrestle well and wield lance, 
<BR>spear, sword and dagger manfully; 
<BR>whose use in others’ hands is wasted." 
</B></H4>

<P>The above verse is by <B>Master Johannes Liechtenauer</B> who lived in the late 14th Century</P>

<H3><B><CENTER>German Longsword Fighting</CENTER></B></H3>
<P></P>

<P>I am currently in the process of Teaching myself German Longsword Fighting in 
the style of <B>Master Johannes Liechtenauer.</B> As it is Master Liechtenauer 
did not include any pictures in his teachings and he even recorded them in 
mnemonic verses which are somewhat hard to understand unless someone explained 
the lessons that went with them.</P>


<P>However a man by the name of Sigmund Ringeck was able to translate the verses 
into a more understandable format explaning things and adding details. The 
comentaries were however writen down in 15th Century German, but Luckily we have 
people today like <I>Christian Henry Tobler</I> who decided it would be fun to 
Translate the Early German into modern english so we can all read it.</P>


<P>He even has his own Highly Recomended book into which he puts down all the 
info that he has discerned from Sigmund Ringeck's Comentares. The book is 
titled: <B><I>SECRETS OF GERMAN MEDIEVAL SWORDSMANSHIP</I></B> complete with 
multiple step by step pictures that are easy to follow.</P>

<P>If you want to get the book check out <A href="http://www.chivalrybookshelf.com/">The Chivalry Bookshelf</A> they also 
have many other great books of the same genre.</P>

<P>Another great sourc for this kind of material is the AEMMA (Academy of 
European Medieval Martial Arts) (<A href="http://www.aemma.org/">AEMMA Web 
Site</A>) Some of the important links as it pretains to 
Longsword Fighting.</P>

<P>I find that Master Liechtenauer's Style of Unarmored Longsword is much 
simpler than some others that you may find out there.
<BR>This is because the number of Core Techniques is kept small and they cover such a large number of 
posibilites</P>

<P>In all there are 17 techniques that Master Liechtenauer teaches these include:</P>
