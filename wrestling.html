<BR>Front Head Lock:  My front head lock may be different than yours so I will describe it to you here
<BR>
<BR>On the Right side:
<BR>
<BR>Your right arm is wrapped around their head with you hand on his chin and that pointy part of your shoulder is positioned on that sensitive spot between his collar bone and the top of his shoulder blade. When you apply pressure this is what will cause the pain :)
<BR>
<BR>Your left hand will be on their arm at or just above the elbow.  You pull rotate their arm up so their shoulder is against their head.

<H3><CENTER>BASIC TIE-UPS</CENTER></H3>

<PRE>
NO TIE-UP  - i.e. Neutral

BEAR CLAW* - One hand inside tie at the top of the tricep.
             The other hand [<I>the bear claw hand</I>] is posted between the neck and the shoulder
             on the other side.
                   -do not wrap it around the neck.
                   *This is just like the standard tie up except you do not wrap the neck.

TWO ON ONE - Holding one of the other persons arm with both of yours.
                   -This can be had with one arm hooking under the top of the arm
                    and the other controling his wrist with your hand.
                   -It can also be done with one hand on the elbow and the other on
                    the wrist
                   *Note: This is done one the outside of the persons body.

UNDERHOOK  - One arm wraping around the shoulder from underneath.
             The other hand is holding the wrist of the opposite arm.

<PRE>
1) Shoot for single.
2) Shoot for double.
3) Tie up in the Bear Claw tie up.
4) Use your head.
     -While fighting for hand control use your forhead to to turn their head sideways.
           -This is helpfull in turning your opponent sideways as well as opening up some areas.

<H3><CENTER>BEAR CLAW</CENTER></H3>
For sake of simplicity The bear claw hand will always be assumed to be your right hand

<PRE>
1) High Crotch:     -Give a shove with your bear claw hand and when your opponent comes back in
                      drop to you right knee and shoot your arm up between his legs.
                    -At the same time you are dropping to your knee you should be pulling your opponents
                      right arm over and behind your head.  It should almost look like your trying to
                      come your hair with the guys arm.

2) Fireman:         -Give a shove with your bear claw hand and when your opponent comes back in
                      drop to your knees and shoot your arm up between his legs and complete the fireman.

3) Snap Down:       -For this one the bear claw hand goes to the neck.
                    -Give a sharp pull in the downwards direction as if you were going to bounce you opponents
                      head off the matt

4) Snap Single/Double:     -Do a snap down and when your opponent comes back up preform a single/double leg
                             takedown

5) Switch to Two On One:   a) Sometimes you can get this by just grabbing a wrist, pulling down and then
                              hooking under his arm with your other arm.
                           b) Your opponent drapes his right hand over your left arm:
                                   -Grab his right hand/wrist with your right hand and pull down.
                                   -Slide your left arm into the position.

6) Switch to Underhook

<H3><CENTER>TWO ON ONE</CENTER></H3>
<PRE>
From the Two On One:

-With arm up near shoulder-

If He: 1) Is sideways relative to you:
            a) Drop to a single.
            b) Jump back and around to pull him in front of you and slam down a front
               head lock.

       2) Posts his other hand on your head:
            -Pop his posting arm up at or above the shoulder and:
                  a) drop to a far double.
                  b) duck under the arm for a bear hug.

       3) Grabs the wrist of the hand you are controling his hand with:
            -Wrap the other arm around the second arm [you should now have both of his
             arms wrapped with the arm you have closest to his body]  Now swing his
             arms througth to the other side of your body drop to a knee and pick the 
             far ankle*
                  *note: when you do this you have to let go with the hand that was
                         controling his wrist to pick the ankle with that hand, also if
                         you are picking with your right hand you should be picking his 
                         right foot.  Same goes for the left side.
